This is a book created by students in Hult's SCI-1 Computer Science Class. When completed it will tell the story of computing from the very beginning
to the age of social media. The aim of this book is to bring out various inflection points in computing history, and how these technologies and moments
changed our economic and personal lives in huge ways.

This book is written by the students together on github and is an open book. Fork this repository and submit pull requests to us if you would like to help!
